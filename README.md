# Mastering Bootstrap 4
This is the code repository for [Mastering Bootstrap 4](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-bootstrap-4?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783981120), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
<title>MyPhoto</title>
```

This book targets intermediate-level frontend web developers. The book is not intended to
be an introduction to web development. As such, we assume that readers have a firm grasp
of the basic concepts behind web development, essential HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills,
as well as practical experience of applying this knowledge. Furthermore, the reader should
have an understanding of jQuery. Elementary knowledge about AngularJS, build tools, and
React are desirable for the book's final two chapters. However, unfamiliarity with the two
frameworks will not stop readers from completing and understanding the examples.
